# Weather-App
🚀 Exciting Project Announcement! 🌦️

I’m thrilled to share my first project – a Real-Time Weather App 🌍🌤️!

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to get up-to-date weather information for any location in the world. This project has helped me deepen my understanding of front-end development, APIs, and real-time data handling.

Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think! Feedback is always welcome. 😊
